# Sorting Algorithm

![](src/main/resources/Sort.gif)


# Overview

This Program Lets the user choose from a variety of sorting algorithms and race two of them side by side. It visually demonstrates the sorting process of each algorithm and compares their time complexity relative to eachother.

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my skills with the Java programming language, as well as my understanding of Object Oriented Programming, Data Structures, and Algorithms.

The Code applies Object Oriented Programming concepts, such as Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polyorphism. It also follows basic Java conventions and best practices.

# Development Environment

This program was written entirely in Java.

The JavaFX library was used to produce the window and animations.

IntelliJ IDEA was used for the IDE.
